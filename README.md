## Synopsis

This is a quick and dirty node app that intercepts traffic from an amazon dash button and creates a hipchat notification (think doorbell)

This sits on top of the work of Alex Hortin and his [node-dash library](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button)

## Installation

See the above link to Alex's node-dash library on how to find the mac address of your dash button and fill out the config.js file with the correct fields.

    npm install
    sudo node index.js

## Contributors

Feel free to contribute/fork, I expect a slack version to show up at some point.
